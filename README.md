<h3>What is this?</h3>
<br>
<h5>-I'm glad you asked! This is a prom voting app for Fort Mill High School. It was designed for mobile devices
only, mainly because this project was not high priority for me and it was only needed for iPad screens or smaller.</h5>
<br>
<br>
<h3>C-Can i use it?</h3>
<br>
<h5>-Yes you may mate! A lot of the code is hardcoded in meaning you would have to change a ton of names, this would mainly be a good resource for anyone wanting to start deving for the web.</h5>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Where is your other work?</h3>
<br>
<h5>-I do have some other short projects on my github, soon to be a couple of long term ones being added this year. Check out the social links if you want to find me.</h5>
